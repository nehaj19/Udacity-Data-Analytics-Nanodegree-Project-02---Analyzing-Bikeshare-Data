# Udacity-Data-Analytics-Nanodegree-Project-02---Analyzing US Bikeshare Data

Use Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major systems in the US. The data will need to be munged into shape before being analyzed using descriptive statistics before being visualized.

The purpose of this task to continue to become familiar with the data analysis process.
1.	Explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States: Chicago, New York and Washington DC
2.	Perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems
3.	Compute descriptive statistics in Python, pandas and NumPy to answer the questions posed about the data

File Descriptions:
1.	./data/ contains the various datasets
2.	./bikeshare_2.py is a containing the work I have done
